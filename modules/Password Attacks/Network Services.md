During our penetration tests, every computer network we encounter will have services installed to manage, edit, or create content. All these services are hosted using specific permissions and are assigned to specific users. Apart from web applications, these services include (but are not limited to):

| **`FTP`** | **`SMB`** | **`NFS`** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`IMAP/POP3`** | **`SSH`** | **`MySQL/MSSQL`** |
| **`RDP`** | **`WinRM`** | **`VNC`** |
| **`Telnet`** | **`SMTP`** | **`LDAP`** |

For further reading on many of these services, check out the [Footprinting](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/footprinting) module on HTB Academy.

Let us imagine that we want to manage a Windows server over the network. Accordingly, we need a service that allows us to access the system, execute commands on it, or access its contents via a GUI or the terminal. In this case, the most common services suitable for this are `RDP`, `WinRM`, and `SSH`. SSH is now much less common on Windows, but it is the leading service for Linux-based systems.

All these services have an authentication mechanism using a username and password. Of course, these services can be modified and configured so that only predefined keys can be used for logging in, but they are configured with default settings in many cases.

## **WinRM**

[Windows Remote Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal) (`WinRM`) is the Microsoft implementation of the network protocol [Web Services Management Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/ws-management-protocol) (`WS-Management`). It is a network protocol based on XML web services using the [Simple Object Access Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/windows-remote-management-glossary) (`SOAP`) used for remote management of Windows systems. It takes care of the communication between [Web-Based Enterprise Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-Based_Enterprise_Management) (`WBEM`) and the [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page) (`WMI`), which can call the [Distributed Component Object Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dcom/4a893f3d-bd29-48cd-9f43-d9777a4415b0) (`DCOM`).

However, for security reasons, WinRM must be activated and configured manually in Windows 10. Therefore, it depends heavily on the environment security in a domain or local network where we want to use WinRM. In most cases, one uses certificates or only specific authentication mechanisms to increase its security. WinRM uses the TCP ports `5985` (`HTTP`) and `5986` (`HTTPS`).

A handy tool that we can use for our password attacks is [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec), which can also be used for other protocols such as SMB, LDAP, MSSQL, and others. We recommend reading the [official documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20231116172005/https://www.crackmapexec.wiki/) for this tool to become familiar with it.

### **CrackMapExec**

#### **Installing CrackMapExec**

We can install `CrackMapExec` via apt on a Parrot host or clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) and follow the various [installation](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec/wiki/Installation) methods, such as installing from source and avoiding dependency issues.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt-get -y install crackmapexec
```

> **Note:** Alternatively, we can install [NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec) to follow along using `sudo apt-get -y install netexec`

#### **CrackMapExec Menu Options**

Running the tool with the `-h` flag will show us general usage instructions and some options available to us.

  -k, --kerberos        Use Kerberos authentication from ccache file (KRB5CCNAME)

<SNIP>

```

#### **CrackMapExec Usage**

The general format for using CrackMapExec is as follows:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec <proto> <target-IP> -u <user or userlist> -p <password or passwordlist>

```

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec winrm 10.129.42.197 -u user.list -p password.list

WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] None (name:10.129.42.197) (domain:None)
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] http://10.129.42.197:5985/wsman
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [+] None\user:password (Pwn3d!)
```

The appearance of `(Pwn3d!)` is the sign that we can most likely execute system commands if we log in with the brute-forced user. Another handy tool that we can use to communicate with the WinRM service is [Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm), which allows us to communicate with the WinRM service efficiently.

## **SSH**

[Secure Shell](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol) (`SSH`) is a more secure way to connect to a remote host to execute system commands or transfer files from a host to a server. The SSH server runs on `TCP port 22` by default, to which we can connect using an SSH client. This service uses three different cryptography operations/methods: `symmetric` encryption, `asymmetric` encryption, and `hashing`.

### **Symmetric Encryption**

Symmetric encryption uses the `same key` for encryption and decryption. However, anyone who has access to the key could also access the transmitted data. Therefore, a key exchange procedure is needed for secure symmetric encryption. The [Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) key exchange method is used for this purpose. If a third party obtains the key, it cannot decrypt the messages because the key exchange method is unknown. However, this is used by the server and client to determine the secret key needed to access the data. Many different variants of the symmetrical cipher system can be used, such as AES, Blowfish, 3DES, etc.

### **Asymmetrical Encryption**

Asymmetric encryption uses `two SSH keys`: a private key and a public key. The private key must remain secret because only it can decrypt the messages that have been encrypted with the public key. If an attacker obtains the private key, which is often not password protected, he will be able to log in to the system without credentials. Once a connection is established, the server uses the public key for initialization and authentication. If the client can decrypt the message, it has the private key, and the SSH session can begin.

### **Hashing**

The hashing method converts the transmitted data into another unique value. SSH uses hashing to confirm the authenticity of messages. This is a mathematical algorithm that only works in one direction.

### **Hydra - SSH**

We can use a tool such as `Hydra` to brute force SSH. This is covered in-depth in the [Login Brute Forcing](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/login-brute-forcing) module.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list ssh://10.129.42.197

```

To log in to the system via the SSH protocol, we can use the OpenSSH client, which is available by default on most Linux distributions.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ ssh user@10.129.42.197

# **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**

Microsoft's [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/understanding-remote-desktop-protocol) (`RDP`) is a network protocol that allows remote access to Windows systems via `TCP port 3389` by default. RDP provides both users and administrators/support staff with remote access to Windows hosts within an organization. The Remote Desktop Protocol defines two participants for a connection: a so-called terminal server, on which the actual work takes place, and a terminal client, via which the terminal server is remotely controlled. In addition to the exchange of image, sound, keyboard, and pointing device, the RDP can also print documents of the terminal server on a printer connected to the terminal client or allow access to storage media available there. Technically, the RDP is an application layer protocol in the IP stack and can use TCP and UDP for data transmission. The protocol is used by various official Microsoft apps, but it is also used in some third-party solutions.

### **Hydra - RDP**

We can also use `Hydra` to perform RDP bruteforcing.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list rdp://10.129.42.197

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

[3389][rdp] host: 10.129.42.197   login: user   password: password
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```

Linux offers different clients to communicate with the desired server using the RDP protocol. These include [Remmina](https://remmina.org/), [rdesktop](http://www.rdesktop.org/), [xfreerdp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xfreerdp), and many others. For our purposes, we will work with xfreerdp.

### **xFreeRDP**

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:<target-IP> /u:<username> /p:<password>
```

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:10.129.42.197 /u:user /p:password

# **SMB**

[Server Message Block](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/microsoft-smb-protocol-and-cifs-protocol-overview) (`SMB`) is a protocol responsible for transferring data between a client and a server in local area networks. It is used to implement file and directory sharing and printing services in Windows networks. SMB is often referred to as a file system, but it is not. SMB can be compared to `NFS` for Unix and Linux for providing drives on local networks.

SMB is also known as [Common Internet File System](https://cifs.com/) (`CIFS`). It is part of the SMB protocol and enables universal remote connection of multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux, or macOS. In addition, we will often encounter [Samba](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Main_Page), which is an open-source implementation of the above functions. For SMB, we can also use `hydra` again to try different usernames in combination with different passwords.

### **Hydra - SMB**

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list smb://10.129.42.197

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

```

However, we may also get the following error describing that the server has sent an invalid reply.

### **Hydra - Error**

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list smb://10.129.42.197

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

```

This is because we most likely have an outdated version of THC-Hydra that cannot handle SMBv3 replies. To work around this problem, we can manually update and recompile `hydra` or use another very powerful tool, the [Metasploit framework](https://www.metasploit.com/).

Now we can use `CrackMapExec` again to view the available shares and what privileges we have for them.

### **CrackMapExec**

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.42.197 -u "user" -p "password" --shares

```

To communicate with the server via SMB, we can use, for example, the tool [smbclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html). This tool will allow us to view the contents of the shares, upload, or download files if our privileges allow it.

### **Smbclient**

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -U user \\\\10.129.42.197\\SHARENAME

Enter WORKGROUP\user's password: *******
