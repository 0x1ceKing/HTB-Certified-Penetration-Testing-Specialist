As we mentioned previously, Metasploit `modules` are prepared scripts with a specific purpose and corresponding functions that have already been developed and tested in the wild. The `exploit` category consists of so-called proof-of-concept (`POCs`) that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities in a largely automated manner. Many people often think that the failure of the exploit disproves the existence of the suspected vulnerability. However, this is only proof that the Metasploit exploit does not work and not that the vulnerability does not exist. This is because many exploits require customization according to the target hosts to make the exploit work. Therefore, automated tools such as the Metasploit framework should only be considered a support tool and not a substitute for our manual skills.

### **Type**

The `Type` tag is the first level of segregation between the Metasploit `modules`. Looking at this field, we can tell what the piece of code for this module will accomplish. Some of these `types` are not directly usable as an `exploit` module would be, for example. However, they are set to introduce the structure alongside the interactable ones for better modularization. To explain better, here are the possible types that could appear in this field:

| **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `Auxiliary` | Scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, and admin capabilities. Offer extra assistance and functionality. |
| `Encoders` | Ensure that payloads are intact to their destination. |
| `Exploits` | Defined as modules that exploit a vulnerability that will allow for the payload delivery. |
| `NOPs` | (No Operation code) Keep the payload sizes consistent across exploit attempts. |
| `Payloads` | Code runs remotely and calls back to the attacker machine to establish a connection (or shell). |
| `Plugins` | Additional scripts can be integrated within an assessment with `msfconsole` and coexist. |
| `Post` | Wide array of modules to gather information, pivot deeper, etc. |

Note that when selecting a module to use for payload delivery, the `use <no.>` command can only be used with the following modules that can be used as `initiators` (or interactable modules):

| **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `Auxiliary` | Scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, and admin capabilities. Offer extra assistance and functionality. |
| `Exploits` | Defined as modules that exploit a vulnerability that will allow for the payload delivery. |
| `Post` | Wide array of modules to gather information, pivot deeper, etc. |

### **OS**

The `OS` tag specifies which operating system and architecture the module was created for. Naturally, different operating systems require different code to be run to get the desired results.

### **Service**

The `Service` tag refers to the vulnerable service that is running on the target machine. For some modules, such as the `auxiliary` or `post` ones, this tag can refer to a more general activity such as `gather`, referring to the gathering of credentials, for example.

### **Name**

Finally, the `Name` tag explains the actual action that can be performed using this module created for a specific purpose.

---

## **Searching for Modules**

Metasploit also offers a well-developed search function for the existing modules. With the help of this function, we can quickly search through all the modules using specific `tags` to find a suitable one for our target.

### **MSF - Search Function**

```
msf6 > help search

Usage: search [<options>] [<keywords>:<value>]

Prepending a value with '-' will exclude any matching results.
If no options or keywords are provided, cached results are displayed.

  search cve:2009 type:exploit
  search cve:2009 type:exploit platform:-linux
  search cve:2009 -s name
  search type:exploit -s type -r
```

For example, we can try to find the `EternalRomance` exploit for older Windows operating systems. This could look something like this:

---

### **MSF - Searching for EternalRomance**

```
msf6 > search eternalromance

================

```

We can also make our search a bit more coarse and reduce it to one category of services. For example, for the CVE, we could specify the year (`cve:<year>`), the platform Windows (`platform:<os>`), the type of module we want to find (`type:<auxiliary/exploit/post>`), the reliability rank (`rank:<rank>`), and the search name (`<pattern>`). This would reduce our results to only those that match all of the above.

### **MSF - Specific Search**

```

---

## **Module Selection**

To select our first module, we first need to find one. Let's suppose that we have a target running a version of SMB vulnerable to EternalRomance (MS17_010) exploits. We have found that SMB server port 445 is open upon scanning the target.

```
th1nyunb0y@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV 10.10.10.40

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-08-13 21:38 UTC

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 60.87 seconds
```

We would boot up `msfconsole` and search for this exact exploit name.

### **MSF - Search for MS17_010**

```
msf6 > search ms17_010

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                                      Disclosure Date  Rank     Check  Description
   -  ----                                      ---------------  ----     -----  -----------
   0  exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue  2017-03-14       average  Yes    MS17-010 EternalBlue SMB Remote Windows Kernel Pool Corruption
   1  exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec       2017-03-14       normal   Yes    MS17-010 EternalRomance/EternalSynergy/EternalChampion SMB Remote Windows Code Execution
   2  auxiliary/admin/smb/ms17_010_command      2017-03-14       normal   No     MS17-010 EternalRomance/EternalSynergy/EternalChampion SMB Remote Windows Command Execution
   3  auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010                         normal   No     MS17-010 SMB RCE Detection
```

Next, we want to select the appropriate module for this scenario. From the `Nmap` scan, we have detected the SMB service running on version `Microsoft Windows 7 - 10`. With some additional OS scanning, we can guess that this is a Windows 7 running a vulnerable instance of SMB. We then proceed to select the module with the `index no. 2` to test if the target is vulnerable.

---

## **Using Modules**

Within the interactive modules, there are several options that we can specify. These are used to adapt the Metasploit module to the given environment. Because in most cases, we always need to scan or attack different IP addresses. Therefore, we require this kind of functionality to allow us to set our targets and fine-tune them. To check which options are needed to be set before the exploit can be sent to the target host, we can use the `show options` command. Everything required to be set before the exploitation can occur will have a `Yes` under the `Required` column.

Here we see how helpful the `No.` tags can be. Because now, we do not have to type the whole path but only the number assigned to the Metasploit module in our search. We can use the command `info` after selecting the module if we want to know something more about the module. This will give us a series of information that can be important for us.

Payload information:
  Space: 3072

Description:
  This module will exploit SMB with vulnerabilities in MS17-010 to 
  achieve a write-what-where primitive. This will then be used to 
  overwrite the connection session information with as an 
  Administrator session. From there, the normal psexec payload code 
  execution is done. Exploits a type confusion between Transaction and 
  WriteAndX requests and a race condition in Transaction requests, as 
  seen in the EternalRomance, EternalChampion, and EternalSynergy 
  exploits. This exploit chain is more reliable than the EternalBlue 
  exploit, but requires a named pipe.

After we are satisfied that the selected module is the right one for our purpose, we need to set some specifications to customize the module to use it successfully against our target host, such as setting the target (`RHOST` or `RHOSTS`).

### **MSF - Target Specification**

In addition, there is the option `setg`, which specifies options selected by us as permanent until the program is restarted. Therefore, if we are working on a particular target host, we can use this command to set the IP address once and not change it again until we change our focus to a different IP address.

Once everything is set and ready to go, we can proceed to launch the attack. Note that the payload was not set here, as the default one is sufficient for this demonstration.

We now have a shell on the target machine, and we can interact with it.

### **MSF - Target Interaction**

```
C:\Windows\system32> whoami

whoami
nt authority\system
```

This has been a quick and dirty example of how `msfconsole` can help out quickly but serves as an excellent example of how the framework works. Only one module was needed without any `payload` selection, `encoding` or `pivoting` between sessions or jobs.
